Please see xtra/pgscript/doc/developers.html for the pgScript developer
documentation.

parser.sh ust be called for regenerating Flex and Bison source files because it
does some more processing that just executing bison and flex: it replaces some
headers and add other ones.

Note that the FlexLexer.h file that comes along with your Flex distribution
must be copied to pgadmin/include/pgscript only if you use parser.sh with a
Flex version different from the one used before. Let's say you download pgAdmin
source code and the pgadmin/include/pgscript/FlexLexer.h corresponds to Flex
2.5.33. If you use Flex 2.5.34 you will need to copy FlexLexr.h from your Flex
distribution to pgadmin/include/pgscript.
