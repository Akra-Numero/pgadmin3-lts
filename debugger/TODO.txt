TODO Items for the debugger:
The debugging of the debugger still continues.^o^

Fixed - Don't use MDI Windows (there is no such concept on Mac).
Fixed - Use wxAUI for the layout.
- Honour customised pgAdmin branding.
Fixed - Store settings per pgAdmin, ie. under HKCU\Software\pgAdmin III or ~/.pgadmin3
- Add support for SSL connected servers (appears to be partiall implemented?)
Fixed - Share i18n message catalogs with pgAdmin.
Fixed - The adjustment is still necessary for handling the debugging line.
