TODO Items for the debugger:

- Don't use MDI Windows (there is no such concept on Mac).
- Use wxAUI for the layout.
- Honour customised pgAdmin branding.
- Store settings per pgAdmin, ie. under HKCU\Software\pgAdmin III or ~/.pgadmin3
- Add support for SSL connected servers (appears to be partiall implemented?)
- Share i18n message catalogs with pgAdmin.
