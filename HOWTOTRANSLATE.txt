If you want to contribute a language to pgAdmin3, do the following:

- download the latest pgadmin3.pot from
  http://cvs.pgadmin.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/pgadmin3 This file will
  be updated, if new strings have been added to the application.

- Use poEdit from poEdit.sourceforge.org. This tool makes it really
  easy to maintain your language. 

- To start a new language, create a directory according to your locale
  canonical name under share/ui. At the moment, you can find en/US,
  fr_FR, ja_JP and de_DE there.

- Copy pgadmin3.pot to that directory, named pgadmin3.po

- Edit that file, using poEdit. As a first action, please edit the
  file properties (Catalog/Settings).  Select correct language and
  country, Charset to utf-8. Project name is pgAdmin3, Team is pgADmin
  Developers, email address should be pgadmin-hackers@postgresql.org. 

- Check the "Automatically compile .mo file on save" in Properties.

- Enter your translation strings.

- When saving, the translation is automatically compiled and usable in
  pgAdmin3. 

- When you're finished, post your resulting pgadmin3.po and
  pgadmin3.mo file to pgadmin-hackers@postgresql.org 

- From time to time, new strings are added to the application, that
  need translation. Download the new pgadmin3.pot, and merge the new
  with your language file using poEdit's "Catalog/Update from POT
  file.." function. 
  
- That's all!
  
  
Thanks for your interest in pgAdmin3!
