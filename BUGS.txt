pgAdmin III Known Issues (Bugs) List
====================================

This file lists the current known issues to be resolved.


Query Builder active in debug builds only:
[Schema Browser]	Menu item 'Query Browser' causes Segfault under unix - crash after qbForm->Show()
                        in frmQueryBuilder::OnSize() at layout.LayoutMDIFrame(this)

[Query Builder]		frmAddTableView: you have to double click buttons!

[Mandrake91]            pgAdmin3 will not compile because of old versions of
                        autoconf (2.13-16mdk) and automake (1.4-21.p6.mdk).
                        Newer versions are not provided by Mandrake Cooker as
                        strange as it may seem. I tried to recompile RedHat
                        ones without success. Therefore, we may need to
                        support older versions of automake and autoconf. 

[SuSE82]                pgAdmin3 does not compile under SuSE82 withou a patch
                        which looks for PostgreSQL libs in non-standard
                        directories. Patch written by Reinhard will be copied
                        to snake as soon as a patch directory is added.
