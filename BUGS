Known issues
============

pgAdmin III
-----------

- [Property]  Working with property dialog after the corresponding node is 
              refreshed crashes
- [Edit grid] Editing very large columns freezes (might be restricted to bytea)
- [Edit grid] bool editing doesn't know NULL; major redesign needed
- [Edit grid] sqlGridTextEditor is broken on Mac. We're currently using 
              wxGridCellAutoWrapStringEditor which works but isn't overly user 
              friendly

wxWidgets
---------

- [Scintilla] ASSERT when typing a multibyte char [wx patch 1072408]
- [Object Tree] Scrollbar doesn't scroll page by page under gtk
- [Scintilla lexer] doesn't know about escaping quotes
- [Main listview] Background behind the tabs doesn't redraw on Win XP and 2003.
- [gtk] FindFocus reports bogus controls. Symptom: select a menu or toolbar, 
        but nothing happens.
- [gtk] combobox positioning when height is not specified; current workaround: 
        fixed 12d height
- [Edit Grid] several platform-dependent misbehaviours when starting editing a 
        cell (F2 or any key): waiting for new wxGrid implementation
- [gtk] Crash with some themes; probably gtk issue.

Known issues, that might stay unfixed
-------------------------------------

- [non-unicode build] Reading unicode files won't convert (wx not capable, use
                      unicode build instead)
- [Object Tree] M$ Context menu key doesn't work in Windows (wxWidgets bug?).
