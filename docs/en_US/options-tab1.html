<h3>pgAdmin Options - Tab 1 (General)</h3>

<center><img src="images/options-tab1.jpg"></center>

<p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Language</b> - When you first started pgAdmin, it will have allowed
  you to select the language it should display. This setting may be changed 
  here.<br>&nbsp;</li>
  
  <li><b>SQL help site</b> - SQL help may be accessed by pressing F1 within 
  pgAdmin, which will display the most appropriate PostgreSQL helpfile for the 
  current object selection or open dialogue. This setting allows you to modify the location under which 
  those files may be found. You may specify a local directory path, or a URL if 
  you wish to use documents on a website. pgAdmin expects to find files at this 
  location from the standard PostgreSQL documentation set.<br>&nbsp;</li>
  
   <li><b>Read and write Unicode UTF-8 files</b> - Select this option to enable 
   pgAdmin to correctly read and write Unicode UTF-8 files.<br>&nbsp;</li>
  
   <li><b>Do not prompt for unsaved files on exit</b> - Selecting this option 
   will prevent pgAdmin from prompting you to save SQL queries upon exit.<br>&nbsp;</li>
  
   <li><b>Confirm object deletion?</b> - Select this option to ensure pgAdmin 
   gives you a chance to confirm before objects are deleted (recommended).<br>&nbsp;</li>
  
   <li><b>Show users for privileges?</b> - When viewing the Privileges tab on 
   objects that support them, selecting this option will include usernames as 
   well as groups in the subject list. Switching off this option is useful on 
   large systems with many users that are organised in groups.<br>&nbsp;</li>

   <li><b>Show object properties on double click in treeview?</b> - Selecting 
   this option will allow double clicking of objects in the treeview to open the 
   Properties dialogue for that object. Some users prefer to disable this option 
   to browse the treeview by double clicking instead.<br>&nbsp;</li>
   
</ul>
