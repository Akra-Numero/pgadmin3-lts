<h3>Property Page Design</h3>

<p>The following email from Andreas outlines the basic layout of the object
property pages in pgAdmin:</p>

As a proposal, this are the sizes and positions I used so far in dlgUser 
and dlgDatabase:

- first control at (10, 10)
- Standard controls are at (100, y) size (200, 20)
- vertical control spacing 25, for radio buttons and checkboxes 20
- static text has a vertical offset of 3 relative to other controls
- Button size is (60, 25) for OK/Cancel, (75, 25) for more text
- controls including statics will need up to 50 % more room for GTK than 
with Win32

For dialogs derived from dlgSecurityProperty, the Security page will be 
created dynamically.
All dialogs will inherit the SQL page from dlgProperty.


Regards,
Andreas
