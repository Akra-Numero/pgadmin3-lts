<H3>Property Page Design</H3>
<P>The following email from Andreas outlines the basic layout of the
object property pages in pgAdmin, updated 16 July:</P>

Subject: [pgadmin-hackers] pgadmin3 property pages design rules

As a proposal, this are the sizes and positions I used so far in dlgUser 
and dlgDatabase:

- first control at (10, 10)
- Standard controls are at (100, y) size (200, 20)
- vertical control spacing 25, for radio buttons and checkboxes 20
- static text has a vertical offset of 3 relative to other controls
- standard Button size is (75, 25)
- controls including statics will need up to 50 % more room for under GTK2 if wxWindows 2.4 is used; 2.5 is recommended.
- statics should be designed with 50 % space in reserve, to leave enough space for translated strings.

For dialogs derived from dlgSecurityProperty, the Security page will be 
created dynamically.
All dialogs will inherit the SQL page from dlgProperty.
