>  The object-relational database management system now known as 
  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> (and briefly called
  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres95</SPAN
>) is derived from the
  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>POSTGRES</SPAN
> package written at the University of
  California at Berkeley.  With over a decade of
  development behind it, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> 
  is the most advanced open-source database available anywhere,
  offering multiversion concurrency control, supporting almost
  all SQL constructs (including subselects, transactions, and
  user-defined types and functions), and having a wide range of
  language bindings available (including C, C++, Java, Perl, Tcl, and Python).

   and  Version  2  was
   released  in  June 1990 with the new rule system.  
   Version 3 appeared in 1991 and added support for  multiple
   storage  managers,  an  improved  query executor, and a
   rewritten rule  system.   For  the  most  part, subsequent
   releases  until <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>Postgres95</SPAN
> (see below)
   focused on portability and reliability.
  </P
><P
>   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>POSTGRES</SPAN
> has been  used
   to  implement  many  different
   research and production applications.  These include: a
   financial data analysis system, a  jet  engine  
   performance   monitoring   package,   an   asteroid  tracking
   database, a medical information database,  and  several
   geographic information systems.  
   <SPAN

   used as an educational tool  at  several  universities.

   picked up
   the code and commercialized it.

  </P

>   The size of the  external  user  community
   nearly  doubled  during  1993.   It became increasingly
   obvious that maintenance of the prototype code and 
   support  was  taking  up large amounts of time that should
   have been devoted to database research.  In  an  effort
   to  reduce  this support burden, the Berkeley
   <SPAN

   ended with Version 4.2.

   Apart from bug fixes, the following were the major enhancements:

      <ACRONYM

      Subqueries were not supported until
      <SPAN

      could be imitated in <SPAN

      re-implemented.  Support for the GROUP BY query clause was also added.
      The <TT
