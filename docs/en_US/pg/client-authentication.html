>  When a client application connects to the database server, it
  specifies which <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> user name it
  wants to connect as, much the same way one logs into a Unix computer
  as a particular user. Within the SQL environment the active database
  user name determines access privileges to database objects -- see
  <A
HREF="user-manag.html"
>Chapter 17</A
> for more information. Therefore, it is
  essential to restrict which database users can connect.
 </P
><P

CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>Authentication</I

  database server establishes the identity of the client, and by
  extension determines whether the client application (or the user
  who runs the client application) is permitted to connect with the
  user name that was requested.
 </P
><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> offers a number of different
  client authentication methods. The method used to authenticate a
  particular client connection can be selected on the basis of
  (client) host address, database, and user.
 </P
><P
>  <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

  separate from user names of the operating system in which the server
  runs. If all the users of a particular server also have accounts on
  the server's machine, it makes sense to assign database user names
  that match their operating system user names. However, a server that
  accepts remote connections may have many database users who have no local operating system
  account, and in such cases there need be no connection between
  database user names and OS user names.
