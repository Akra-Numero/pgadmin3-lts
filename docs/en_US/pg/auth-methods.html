>    The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

    <I
CLASS="CITETITLE"
>RFC 1413</I
>. Virtually every Unix-like
    operating system ships with an ident server that listens on TCP
    port 113 by default. The basic functionality of an ident server
    is to answer questions like <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"What user initiated the
    connection that goes out of your port <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>X</I

    <TT

    can interrogate the ident server on the host of the connecting
    client and could theoretically determine the operating system user
    for any given connection this way.
   </P
><P
>    The drawback of this procedure is that it depends on the integrity
    of the client: if the client machine is untrusted or compromised
    an attacker could run just about any program on port 113 and
    return any user name he chooses. This authentication method is
    therefore only appropriate for closed networks where each client
    machine is under tight control and where the database and system
    administrators operate in close contact. In other words, you must
    trust the machine running the ident server.
