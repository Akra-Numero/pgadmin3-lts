<p>   The following rules govern the visibility of data changes in
   functions that use SPI (or any other C function):

   </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>      During the execution of an SQL command, any data changes made by
      the command are invisible to the command itself.  For
      example, in
</p>
<pre class="programlisting">INSERT INTO a SELECT * FROM a;</pre>
<p>
      the inserted rows are invisible to the <code class="command">SELECT</code>
      part.
     </p>
</li>
<li><p>      Changes made by a command C are visible to all commands that are
      started after C, no matter whether they are started inside C
      (during the execution of C) or after C is done.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      Commands executed via SPI inside a function called by an SQL command
      (either an ordinary function or a trigger) follow one or the
      other of the above rules depending on the read/write flag passed
      to SPI.  Commands executed in read-only mode follow the first
      rule: they can't see changes of the calling command.  Commands executed
      in read-write mode follow the second rule: they can see all changes made
      so far.
     </p></li>
<li><p>      All standard procedural languages set the SPI read-write mode
      depending on the volatility attribute of the function.  Commands of
      <code class="literal">STABLE</code> and <code class="literal">IMMUTABLE</code> functions are done in
      read-only mode, while commands of <code class="literal">VOLATILE</code> functions are
      done in read-write mode.  While authors of C functions are able to
      violate this convention, it's unlikely to be a good idea to do so.
     </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
  </p>
<p>   The next section contains an example that illustrates the
   application of these rules.
