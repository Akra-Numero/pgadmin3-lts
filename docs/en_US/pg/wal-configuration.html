>   <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>Checkpoints</I
> are points in the sequence of
   transactions at which it is guaranteed that the data files have
   been updated with all information logged before the checkpoint.  At
   checkpoint time, all dirty data pages are flushed to disk and a
   special checkpoint record is written to the log file. As result, in
   the event of a crash, the recoverer knows from what record in the
   log (known as the redo record) it should start the REDO operation,
   since any changes made to data files before that record are already
   on disk. After a checkpoint has been made, any log segments written
   before the undo records are no longer needed and can be recycled or
   removed. (When <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</SPAN
>-based <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>BAR</SPAN
> is
   implemented, the log segments would be archived before being recycled
   or removed.)
  </P
><P
>   The postmaster spawns a special backend process every so often
   to create the next checkpoint.  A checkpoint is created every
   <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CHECKPOINT_SEGMENTS</TT
> log segments, or every
   <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CHECKPOINT_TIMEOUT</TT
> seconds, whichever comes first.
   The default settings are 3 segments and 300 seconds respectively.
   It is also possible to force a checkpoint by using the SQL command
   <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CHECKPOINT</TT
>.
  </P
><P
>   Reducing <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CHECKPOINT_SEGMENTS</TT
> and/or
   <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CHECKPOINT_TIMEOUT</TT
> causes checkpoints to be done
   more often. This allows faster after-crash recovery (since less work
   will need to be redone). However, one must balance this against the
   increased cost of flushing dirty data pages more often. In addition,
   to ensure data page consistency, the first modification of a data
   page after each checkpoint results in logging the entire page
   content. Thus a smaller checkpoint interval increases the volume of
   output to the log, partially negating the goal of using a smaller
   interval, and in any case causing more disk I/O.
  </P
><P
>   There will be at least one 16MB segment file, and will normally 
   not be more than 2 * <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CHECKPOINT_SEGMENTS</TT
>
   + 1 files.  You can use this to estimate space requirements for 
   WAL.  Ordinarily, when old log segment files are no longer needed, 
   they are recycled (renamed to become the next sequential future 
   segments). If, due to a short-term peak of log output rate, there 
   are more than 2 * <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>CHECKPOINT_SEGMENTS</TT
> + 1 segment files, 
   the unneeded segment files will be deleted instead of recycled until the
   system gets back under this limit.
  </P

>   There are two commonly used <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</SPAN
> functions:
   <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogFlush</TT
>.
   <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</TT
> is used to place a new record into
   the <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</SPAN
> buffers in shared memory. If there is no
   space for the new record, <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</TT
> will have
   to write (move to kernel cache) a few filled <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</SPAN
>
   buffers. This is undesirable because <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</TT
>
   is used on every database low level modification (for example,
   tuple insertion) at a time when an exclusive lock is held on
   affected data pages, so the operation needs to be as fast as
   possible.  What is worse, writing <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</SPAN
> buffers may
   also force the creation of a new log segment, which takes even more
   time. Normally, <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</SPAN
> buffers should be written
   and flushed by a <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogFlush</TT
> request, which is
   made, for the most part, at transaction commit time to ensure that
   transaction records are flushed to permanent storage. On systems
   with high log output, <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogFlush</TT
> requests may
   not occur often enough to prevent <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</SPAN
> buffers
   being written by <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</TT
>. On such systems
   one should increase the number of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</SPAN
> buffers by
   modifying the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>postgresql.conf</TT
> <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>   WAL_BUFFERS</TT
> parameter. The default number of <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>   WAL</SPAN
> buffers is 8.  Increasing this value will 
   correspondingly increase shared memory usage.
  </P
><P
>   The <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>COMMIT_DELAY</TT
> parameter defines for how many
   microseconds the backend will sleep after writing a commit
   record to the log with <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</TT
> but before
   performing a <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogFlush</TT
>. This delay allows other
   backends to add their commit records to the log so as to have all
   of them flushed with a single log sync. No sleep will occur if <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>fsync</TT
>
   is not enabled or if fewer than <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>COMMIT_SIBLINGS</TT
>
   other backends are not currently in active transactions; this avoids
   sleeping when it's unlikely that any other backend will commit soon.
   Note that on most platforms, the resolution of a sleep request is
   ten milliseconds, so that any nonzero <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>COMMIT_DELAY</TT
>
   setting between 1 and 10000 microseconds will have the same effect.
   Good values for these parameters are not yet clear; experimentation
   is encouraged.
  </P
><P
>   The <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>WAL_SYNC_METHOD</TT
> parameter determines how
   <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> will ask the kernel to force
    WAL updates out to disk. 
   All the options should be the same as far as reliability goes,
   but it's quite platform-specific which one will be the fastest.
   Note that this parameter is irrelevant if <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>FSYNC</TT
>
   has been turned off.
  </P
><P
>   Setting the <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>WAL_DEBUG</TT
> parameter to any nonzero
   value will result in each <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogInsert</TT
> and
   <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>LogFlush</TT
> <SPAN
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>WAL</SPAN
> call being
   logged to standard error.  At present, it makes no difference what
   the nonzero value is.  This option may be replaced by a more
   general mechanism in the future.
