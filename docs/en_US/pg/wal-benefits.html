<a name="id618767"></a><p>    The first major benefit of using <span class="acronym">WAL</span> is a
    significantly reduced number of disk writes, because only the log
    file needs to be flushed to disk at the time of transaction
    commit, rather than every data file changed by the transaction.
    In multiuser environments, commits of many transactions
    may be accomplished with a single <code class="function">fsync</code> of
    the log file. Furthermore, the log file is written sequentially,
    and so the cost of syncing the log is much less than the cost of
    flushing the data pages.   This is especially true for servers
    handling many small transactions touching different parts of the data
    store.
   </p>
<p>    The next benefit is consistency of the data pages. The truth is
    that, before <span class="acronym">WAL</span>,
    <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> was never able to guarantee
    consistency in the case of a crash.  Before
    <span class="acronym">WAL</span>, any crash during writing could result in:

    </p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1">
<li>index rows pointing to nonexistent table rows</li>
<li>index rows lost in split operations</li>
<li>totally corrupted table or index page content, because
      of partially written data pages</li>
</ol></div>
<p>

    Problems with indexes (problems 1 and 2) could possibly have been
    fixed by additional <code class="function">fsync</code> calls, but it is
    not obvious how to handle the last case without
    <span class="acronym">WAL</span>.  <span class="acronym">WAL</span> saves the entire data
    page content in the log if that is required to ensure page
    consistency for after-crash recovery.
   </p>
<p>    Finally, <span class="acronym">WAL</span> makes it possible to support on-line
    backup and point-in-time recovery, as described in <a href="backup-online.html" title="23.3. On-line backup and point-in-time recovery (PITR)">Section 23.3, &#8220;On-line backup and point-in-time recovery (PITR)&#8221;</a>.  By archiving the WAL data we can support
    reverting to any time instant covered by the available WAL data:
    we simply install a prior physical backup of the database, and
    replay the WAL log just as far as the desired time.  What's more,
    the physical backup doesn't have to be an instantaneous snapshot
    of the database state [mdash ] if it is made over some period of time,
    then replaying the WAL log for that period will fix any internal
    inconsistencies.
