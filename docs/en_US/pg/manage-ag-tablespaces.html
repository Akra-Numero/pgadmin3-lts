></H1
><P
>    Tablespaces in <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> allow database administrators to
    define locations in the file system where the files representing
    database objects can be stored. Once created, a tablespace can be referred
    to by name when creating database objects.
   </P
><P
>    By using tablespaces, a database administrator can control the disk
    layout of a <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> installation. This is useful in
    at least two ways. Firstly, if the partition or volume on which the cluster
    was initialized runs out of space and cannot be extended logically
    or otherwise, a tablespace can be created on a different partition
    and used until the system can be reconfigured.
   </P
><P
>    Secondly, tablespaces allow a database administrator to arrange data
    locations based on the usage patterns of database objects. For
    example, an index which is very heavily used can be placed on very fast,
    highly available disk, such as an expensive solid state device. At the same
    time a table storing archived data which is rarely used or not performance
    critical could be stored on a less expensive, slower disk system.
   </P
><P
>    To define a tablespace, use the <A
HREF="sql-createtablespace.html"
>CREATE TABLESPACE</A
>
    command, for example:<A
NAME="AEN18613"
></A
>
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE TABLESPACE fastspace LOCATION '/mnt/sda1/postgresql/data';</PRE
><P>
    The location must be an existing, empty directory that is owned by
    the <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> system user.  All objects subsequently
    created within the tablespace will be stored in files underneath this
    directory.
   </P

CLASS="NOTE"

CLASS="NOTE"

><B
>Note: </B
>    There is usually not much point in making more than one
    tablespace per logical filesystem, since you can't control the location
    of individual files within a logical filesystem.  However,
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> does not enforce any such limitation, and
    indeed it's not directly aware of the filesystem boundaries on your
    system.  It just stores files in the directories you tell it to use.
   </P
></BLOCKQUOTE

><P
>    Creation of the tablespace itself must be done as a database superuser,
    but after that you can allow ordinary database users to make use of it.
    To do that, grant them the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CREATE</TT
> privilege on it.
   </P
><P
>    Databases, schemas, tables, and indexes can all be assigned to
    particular tablespaces. To do so, a user with the <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CREATE</TT
>
    privilege on a given tablespace must pass the tablespace name as a 
    parameter to the relevant command. For example, the following creates 
    a table in the tablespace <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>space1</TT
>:
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>CREATE TABLE foo(i int) TABLESPACE space1;</PRE
><P>
   </P
><P
>    The tablespace associated with a database is used to store the system
    catalogs of that database, as well as any temporary files created by
    server processes using that database.  Furthermore, it is the default
    tablespace selected for any objects created within the database, if
    no specific <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>TABLESPACE</TT
> clause is given when those objects
    are created.  If a database is created without specifying a tablespace
    for it, it uses the same tablespace as the template database it is copied
    from.
   </P
><P
>    A schema does not in itself occupy any storage (other than a system
    catalog entry), so assigning a tablespace to a schema does not in itself
    do anything.  What this actually does is to set a default tablespace
    for tables later created within the schema.  If
    no tablespace is mentioned when creating a schema, it inherits its
    default tablespace from the current database.
   </P
><P
>    The default choice of tablespace for an index is the same tablespace
    already assigned to the table the index is for.
   </P
><P
>    Another way to state the above rules is that when a schema, table, or index
    is created without specifying a tablespace, the object
    inherits its logical parent's tablespace. A schema will be created in the
    current database's tablespace; a table will be created in the
    tablespace of the schema it is being created in; an index will be created
    in the tablespace of the table underlying the index.
   </P
><P
>    Two tablespaces are automatically created by <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>initdb</TT
>. The
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_global</TT
> tablespace is used for shared system catalogs. The
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_default</TT
> tablespace is the default tablespace of the
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>template1</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>template0</TT
> databases (and, therefore,
    will be the default tablespace for everything else as well, unless
    explicit <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>TABLESPACE</TT
> clauses are used somewhere along the
    line).
   </P
><P
>    Once created, a tablespace can be used from any database, provided
    the requesting user has sufficient privilege. This means that a tablespace
    cannot be dropped until all objects in all databases using the tablespace
    have been removed.
   </P
><P
>    To simplify the implementation of tablespaces, 
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> makes extensive use of symbolic links. This
    means that tablespaces can be used <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>only</I
></SPAN
> on systems
    that support symbolic links.
   </P
><P
>    The directory <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>$PGDATA/pg_tblspc</TT
> contains symbolic links that
    point to each of the non-built-in tablespaces defined in the cluster.
    Although not recommended, it is possible to adjust the tablespace
    layout by hand by redefining these links.  Two warnings: do not do so
    while the postmaster is running; and after you restart the postmaster,
    update the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>pg_tablespace</TT
> catalog to show the new
    locations.  (If you do not, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>pg_dump</TT
> will continue to show
    the old tablespace locations.)
