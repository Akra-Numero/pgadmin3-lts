NAME="DISABLE-AUTOCOMMIT"

><P
>    Turn off autocommit and just do one commit at
    the end.  (In plain SQL, this means issuing <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>BEGIN</TT
>
    at the start and <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>COMMIT</TT
> at the end.  Some client
    libraries may do this behind your back, in which case you need to
    make sure the library does it when you want it done.)
    If you allow each insertion to be committed separately,
    <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN
> is doing a lot of work for each
    record added.
    An additional benefit of doing all insertions in one transaction
    is that if the insertion of one record were to fail then the
    insertion of all records inserted up to that point would be rolled
    back, so you won't be stuck with partially loaded data.

    planning, etc.
    overhead a great deal. If you do this then it is not necessary to turn
    off autocommit, since it is only one command anyway.

    create the table, bulk-load with <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"

    indexes needed 
    for the table.  Creating an index on pre-existing data is quicker than
    updating it incrementally as each record is loaded.
   </P
><P
>    If you are augmenting an existing table, you can <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>DROP
    INDEX</TT
>, load the table, then recreate the index. Of
    course, the database performance for other users may be adversely 
    affected during the time that the index is missing.  One should also
    think twice before dropping unique indexes, since the error checking
    afforded by the unique constraint will be lost while the index is missing.

    ANALYZE</TT
> anytime you've added or updated a lot of data,
    including just after initially populating a table.  This ensures that
    the planner has up-to-date statistics about the table.  With no statistics
    or obsolete statistics, the planner may make poor choices of query plans,
    leading to bad performance on queries that use your table.
