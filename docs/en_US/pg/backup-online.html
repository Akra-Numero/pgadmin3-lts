>   At all times, <SPAN

   files.  This log exists primarily for crash-safety purposes: if the system
   crashes, the database can be restored to consistency by <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

   the log entries made since the last checkpoint.  However, the existence
   of the log makes it possible to use a third strategy for backing up
   databases: we can combine a filesystem-level backup with backup of the WAL
   files.  If recovery is needed, we restore the backup and then replay from
   the backed-up WAL files to bring the backup up to current time.  This
   approach is notably more complex to administer than either of the previous
   approaches, but it has some significant benefits to offer:
  <P
></P
></P><UL
><LI
><P
>     We do not need a perfectly consistent backup as the starting point.
     Any internal inconsistency in the backup will be corrected by log
     replay (this is not significantly different from what happens during
     crash recovery).  So we don't need filesystem snapshot capability,
     just <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>tar</SPAN
> or a similar archiving tool.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>     Since we can string together an indefinitely long sequence of WAL files
     for replay, continuous backup can be had simply by continuing to archive
     the WAL files.  This is particularly valuable for large databases, where
     making a full backup may take an unreasonable amount of time.
    </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>     There is nothing that says we have to replay the WAL entries all the
     way to the end.  We could stop the replay at any point and have a
     consistent snapshot of the database as it was at that time.  Thus,
     this technique supports <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>point-in-time recovery</I

     possible to restore the database to its state at any time since your base
     backup was taken.

  </P
><P
>   As with the plain filesystem-backup technique, this method can only
   support restoration of an entire database cluster, not a subset.
   Also, it requires a lot of archival storage: the base backup is bulky,
   and a busy system will generate many megabytes of WAL traffic that
   have to be archived.  Still, it is the preferred backup technique in
   many situations where high reliability is needed.
  </P
><P
>   To recover successfully using an on-line backup, you need a continuous
   sequence of archived WAL files that extends back at least as far as the

    which are normally 16Mb apiece (although the size can be altered when
    building the server).  The segment files are given numeric names that
    reflect their position in the abstract WAL sequence.  When not using WAL
    archiving, the system normally creates just a few segment files and then
    <SPAN

    recycled.
   </P
><P
>    When archiving WAL data, we want to capture the contents of each segment
    file once it is filled, and save that data somewhere before the segment
    file is recycled for reuse.  Depending on the application and the

CLASS="QUOTE"

    the administrator specify a shell command to be executed to copy a

    as simple as a <SPAN

    the series of WAL files being archived contains effectively everything
    in your database, you will want to be sure that the archived data is

    soon thereafter.  However, a nonzero status tells

    again periodically until it succeeds.
   </P
><P
>    Speed of the archiving command is not important, so long as it can keep up
    with the average rate at which your server generates WAL data.  It is okay
    if the archiving process falls a little behind (or even a lot behind, if
    you don't mind the <TT

    not-yet-archived segment files).
   </P
><P
>    If you are concerned about being able to recover right up to the current
    instant, you may want to take additional steps to ensure that the current,
    partially-filled WAL segment is also copied someplace.  This is
    particularly important if your server generates only little WAL traffic
    (or has slack periods where it does so), since it could take a long time
    before a WAL segment file is completely filled and ready to archive.
    One possible way to handle this is to set up a <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>cron</SPAN
> job
    that periodically (once a minute, perhaps) identifies the current WAL
    segment file and saves it someplace safe.  The combination of the archived
    WAL segments and the saved current segment will then be enough to ensure
    you can always restore to within a minute of current time.  This behavior
    is not presently built into <SPAN

    The <A

    WAL segments that will not change anymore; and except in the case of
    retrying a failure, it will be called only once for any given file name.

   </P
><P
>    To make use of this backup, you will need to keep around all the WAL
    segment files generated at or after the starting time of the backup.
    To aid you in doing this, the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_stop_backup</CODE
> function
    creates a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>backup history file</I
> that is immediately stored
    into the WAL archive area.  This file is named after the first WAL
    segment file that you need to have to make use of the backup.  For
    example, if the starting WAL file is <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0000000100001234000055CD</TT
>
    the backup history file will be named something like
    <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>0000000100001234000055CD.007C9330.backup</TT
>.  (The second part of
    this file name stands for an exact position within the WAL file, and can
    ordinarily be ignored.)  Once you have safely archived the backup dump
    file, you can delete all archived WAL segments with names numerically
    preceding this one.  The backup history file is just a small text file.
    It contains the label string you gave to <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_start_backup</CODE
>, as
    well as the starting and ending times of the backup.  If you used the
    label to identify where the associated dump file is kept, then the
    archived history file is enough to tell you which dump file to restore,
    should you need to do so.
   </P
><P
>    Since you have to keep around all the archived WAL files back to your
    last full dump, your interval between full dumps would usually be chosen
    based on how much storage you want to expend on archived WAL files.
    You should also consider how long you are prepared to spend recovering,
    if recovery should be necessary --- the system will have to replay all
    those segments, and that could take awhile if it's been a long time
    since the full dump.
   </P
><P
>    It's also worth noting that the <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_start_backup</CODE

    makes a file named <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>backup_label</TT
> in the database cluster
    directory, which is then removed again by <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_stop_backup</CODE
>.
    This file will of course be archived as a part of your backup dump file.
    The backup label file includes the label string you gave to
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_start_backup</CODE
>, as well as the time at which
    <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>pg_start_backup</CODE
> was run, and the name of the starting WAL
    file.  In case of confusion it will
    therefore be possible to look inside a backup dump file and determine
    exactly which backup session the dump file came from.

    the database universe, you never dropped the table at all.  But suppose
    you later realize this wasn't such a great idea after all, and would like
    to return to some later point in the original history?  You won't be able
    to if, while your database was up-and-running, it overwrote some of the
    sequence of WAL segment files that led up to the time you now wish you
    could get back to.  So you really want to distinguish the series of
    WAL records generated after you've done a point-in-time recovery from
    those that were generated in the original database history.

>    To deal with these problems, <SPAN
CLASS="PRODUCTNAME"
>PostgreSQL</SPAN

    of <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>timelines</I
>.  Each time you recover to a point-in-time
    earlier than the end of the WAL sequence, a new timeline is created
    to identify the series of WAL records generated after that recovery.
    (If recovery proceeds all the way to the end of WAL, however, we do not
    start a new timeline: we just extend the existing one.)  The timeline
    ID number is part of WAL segment file names, and so a new timeline does
    not overwrite the WAL data generated by previous timelines.  It is
    in fact possible to archive many different timelines.  While that might
    seem like a useless feature, it's often a lifesaver.  Consider the
    situation where you aren't quite sure what point-in-time to recover to,
    and so have to do several point-in-time recoveries by trial and error
    until you find the best place to branch off from the old history.  Without
    timelines this process would soon generate an unmanageable mess.  With
    timelines, you can recover to <SPAN

> prior state, including
    states in timeline branches that you later abandoned.

    a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

> file that shows which timeline it branched
    off from and when.  These history files are necessary to allow the system
    to pick the right WAL segment files when recovering from an archive that
    contains multiple timelines.  Therefore, they are archived into the WAL
    archive area just like WAL segment files.  The history files are just
    small text files, so it's cheap and appropriate to keep them around
    indefinitely (unlike the segment files which are large).  You can, if
    you like, add comments to a history file to make your own notes about
    how and why this particular timeline came to be.  Such comments will be
    especially valuable when you have a thicket of different timelines as
    a result of experimentation.

>    The default behavior of recovery is to recover along the same timeline
    that was current when the base backup was taken.  If you want to recover
    into some child timeline (that is, you want to return to some state that
    was itself generated after a recovery attempt), you need to specify the
    target timeline in <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>recovery.conf</TT
>.  You cannot recover into
    timelines that branched off earlier than the base backup.

    format is extremely bulky since it includes many disk page
    snapshots.  This is appropriate for crash recovery purposes,
    since we may need to fix partially-written disk pages.  It is not
    necessary to store so many page copies for PITR operations, however.
    An area for future development is to compress archived WAL data by
    removing unnecessary page copies.
