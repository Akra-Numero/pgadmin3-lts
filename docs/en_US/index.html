<h3>pgAdmin III</h3>
<p>pgAdmin III is a comprehensive <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL 
database</a> design and management system for *nix and Windows systems. It is 
freely available under the terms of the <a 
href="licence.html">Artistic Licence</a> and may be redistributed 
provided the terms of the licence are adhered to. The project is managed by the
<a href="team.html">pgAdmin Development Team</a>.</p>

<p>This software was written as a successor to the original pgAdmin and pgAdmin II products, 
which though popular, had limitations in the design that prevented them being 
taken to the 'next level'. pgAdmin III is written in C++ and uses the excellent 
<a href="www.wxwindows.org">wxWindows</a> cross platform toolkit. Connection to PostgreSQL
is made using the native libpq library.</p>

instructions and technical notes.</p>
