<h3>Object search</h3>
<center><img src="images/search.png"></center><br/>
<p>
With this dialog, you can search for almost any kind of objects in a
database.
</p>
<p>
You can access it by right clicking a database and select "Search objects"
or by hitting CTRL-G.
The minimum pattern length are 3 characters except for operators. The
search performed is non-case sensitive and will find all objets whose name
contains the pattern. You can only search for object names.
</p>
<p>
The result is presented in the grid with object type, object name and
the object tree path. You can click on a result row to select the object
in the <A HREF="main.html">browser</A>. If the object is grey, this means
that you don't have enabled those object types in the <A
HREF="options-tab3.html">Browser settings</A> (third tab of the Options
dialog), so you can't click on it.
