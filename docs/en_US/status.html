<h3>Database Server Status</h3>

<center><img src="images/status.jpg"></center>

<p>
The Server Status dialogue displays the current connections to each
database, the user that is connected, the process ID, the current
query being executed (if any), and the query start time (where appropriate) 
on PostgreSQL 7.4 and above on the Status tab.
</p>

<p>
The Locks tab shows the current locks outstanding in the PostgreSQL Lock
Manager. This information can be useful when attempting to debug or track
down deadlocks on your server. Not all information is necessarily shown
for each lock. In particular, the Relation name may be shown as an OID
instead of by it's name, if the relation is in a different database to 
that being monitored.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> When the pg_locks view is accessed as is the case whenever 
this dialgue is open, PostgreSQL's internal lock manager data structures are 
momentarily locked, and a copy is made for the dialogue to display. This 
ensures that the dialogue displays a consistent set of results, while not 
blocking normal lock manager operations longer than necessary. Nonetheless 
there could be some impact on database performance if this view is read often.
