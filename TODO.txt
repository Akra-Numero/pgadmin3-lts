pgAdmin III To-Do List
======================

Essentials
==========

- New pgAdmin III specific part of the website with screenshots etc.

Enhancements
============

- most property dlgs: check for readOnly if no sufficient rights are available
- Make dist should also write the proper versions in pgadmin3 spec file.
- http://www.pgadmin.org/snapshots/.. truncates the display of package names.
  http://snake.pgadmin.org does not.


Enhancements delayed for the next release
============
- Operator class property: to implement

Controversial :-)
=================

- Cursor based query tool. 
  * Remark (AP): considered this to be implemented external to pgAdmin3
- Allow modification of column types by adding new columns, moving data and
  then recreating dependent objects as required.
  * Remark (AP): Touches dependencies, thus considered critical. 
                 Partial change of type/length/precision is already supported.

Language issues
=================
- Function properties: not enough space to translate "security definer", "returns recordset", etc...
  Could it be possible for checkboxes to be before the text and not after it.
