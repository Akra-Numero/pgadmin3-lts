pgAdmin III To-Do List
======================

Essentials
==========

- New pgAdmin III specific part of the website with screenshots etc.

Enhancements
============

- Add VERBOSE option to VACUUM dialogue, and display output.
- Add ANALYSE only support.
- Table property: inheritance
- Operator class property: to implement
- most property dlgs: check for readOnly
- autoconf and automake should support "make dist", as reported by Reinhard
  Max.

Controversial :-)
=================

- Cursor based query tool. 
  * Remark (AP): considered this to be implemented external to pgAdmin3
- Allow modification of column types by adding new columns, moving data and
  then recreating dependent objects as required.
  * Remark (AP): Touches dependencies, thus considered critical. 
                 Partial change of type/length/precision is already supported.
