<ul>
	<li>Essentials
 	<ul>
    	<li>update PostgreSQL 7.4 doc version from Beta to Release when available
		<li>Use latest wxWindows snapshot when wxChmHelpController for gtk is included
	</ul>

	<li>Enhancements
	<ul>
	    <li>Most property dlgs: check for readOnly if no sufficient rights are available
		<li>Make dist should also write the proper versions in pgadmin3 spec file.
		<li>CREATE TABLE LIKE table
	</ul>

	<li>Enhancements delayed for the next release
	<ul>
	    <li>make statistics column headers translatable
		<li>Operator class property: to implement
		<li>better editing in EditGrid (color, validation)
		<li>GRANT wizard
        <li>Apply for some property dialogs
	</ul>

	<li>Major Projects
	<ul>
		<li>Data Import/Export tool, for file & external database IO. Including data transformation.
		<li>Backup/Restore tool. This *must* use PostgreSQL pg_dump code, and not our own clone.
		<li>pgAgent - Basically a cron daemon & console for PostgreSQL.
		<li>Index Checker. A tool to check for missing indexes on FK columns.
		<li>Graphical EXPLAIN.
		<li>pl/pgsql debugger.
	</ul>

	<li>Controversial :-)
	<ul>
		<li>Cursor based query tool.<br>
		    * Remark (AP): considered this to be implemented external to pgAdmin3
		<li>Allow modification of column types by adding new columns, moving data and then recreating dependent objects as required.<br>
		    * Remark (AP): Touches dependencies, thus considered critical.<br>
		    Partial change of type/length/precision is already supported.
	</ul>
</ul>
