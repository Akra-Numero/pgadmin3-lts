pgAdmin III To-Do List
======================

Essentials
==========

- New pgAdmin III specific part of the website with screenshots etc.

Enhancements
============

- Add VERBOSE option to VACUUM dialogue, and display output.
- Add ANALYSE only support.
- display notices sent from backend as appropriate.
- Table property: inheritance
- most property dlgs: check for readOnly
- autoconf and automake should support "make dist", as reported by Reinhard
  Max. Make dist should also write the proper versions in pgadmin3 spec file.
- http://www.pgadmin.org/snapshots/.. truncates the display of package names.
  http://snake.pgadmin.org does not.

Enhancements delayed for the next release
============
- Operator class property: to implement

Controversial :-)
=================

- Cursor based query tool. 
  * Remark (AP): considered this to be implemented external to pgAdmin3
- Allow modification of column types by adding new columns, moving data and
  then recreating dependent objects as required.
  * Remark (AP): Touches dependencies, thus considered critical. 
                 Partial change of type/length/precision is already supported.

Language issues
=================
- SQL pannel: "Analyse", "Explain", "Verbose", "Vacuum", "freeze", "Full" should not be
  translated. Remove _()_ or write them using capital letters?
- Fonction properties: not enough space to translate "security definer", "returns recordset", etc...
  Could it be possible for checkboxes to be before the text and not after it.
- Translations into Farsi or Arabic use large fonts. Dialogs are really too
  small. Cannot be fixed at present because it would require nearly all
  dialogs to resize with text (as in Qt3).
