pgAdmin III To-Do List
======================

Essentials
==========

- New pgAdmin III specific part of the website with screenshots etc.

Enhancements
============

- Add VERBOSE option to VACUUM dialogue, and display output.
- Add ANALYSE only support.
- Table property: inheritance
- most property dlgs: check for readOnly
- autoconf and automake should support "make dist", as reported by Reinhard
  Max. Make dist should also write the proper versions in pgadmin3 spec file.
- Add Refresh button to data viewer.


Enhancements delayed for the next release
============
- Operator class property: to implement

Controversial :-)
=================

- Cursor based query tool. 
  * Remark (AP): considered this to be implemented external to pgAdmin3
- Allow modification of column types by adding new columns, moving data and
  then recreating dependent objects as required.
  * Remark (AP): Touches dependencies, thus considered critical. 
                 Partial change of type/length/precision is already supported.
- During configuration, wxgtk{2}{u}{d}{-2.5}-config should be searched
  according to GTK binding (GTK1 or GTK2), unicode and debug options. Future
  Linux distros may support wxGTK 2.4 and wxGTK2.5 cvs version at once.
  Therefore there can be no symlink wx-config -> wxgtk2ud-2.5-config. Dave
  proposed a working alternative, but I prefer the existing options. Stil to
  be discussed.
