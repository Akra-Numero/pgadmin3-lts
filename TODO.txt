Essentials
==========

- New pgAdmin III specific part of the website with screenshots etc.

Enhancements
============

- Add VERBOSE option to VACUUM dialogue, and display output.
- Add ANALYSE only support.
- Update user enumeration to detect permission denied errors using 7.4 error
  codes or perhaps checking usesuper/table permissions first.
- Allow modification of column types by adding new columns, moving data and
  then recreating dependent objects as required.

Controversial :-)
