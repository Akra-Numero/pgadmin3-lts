To enable translation of pgAdmin3 strings, all candidates need to be marked.

1) A string that will not be translated (queries, log entries, setting tags etc) 
   will be declared with wxT(""), as it is standard in wxWindows to enable unicode.

2) A string that is to be translated, needs to be declared with _(). This will mark
   the string for translation, and will return the translated string.

3) A string that needs translation, but should still be used non-translated at the
   place of definition, needs declaration with __(). Later in the code, the still 
   non-translated string can be translated using wxGetTranslation(). 

The third method must be used for keywords, that sometimes need translation, sometimes 
not. An example is typeNameList in pgObject.cpp. The keywords are used in queries, so
they need to remain untranslated, but may also be shown translated. wxLogError will 
write the string untranslated to the log, but show the text translated in a message box.



Do not translate, using wxT():

- wxLogInfo, wxLogStatus, wxLogSql, wxLogTrace, wxLogDebug arguments
- sysSettings tag names and values
- queries
- reserved SQL words (usually recognizable as all-uppercase words)


Translate, using _():
- all user interface strings that aren't reused for query creation


Mark for translation, using __():
- wxLogFatalError wxLogError, wxLogWarning, wxLogMessage
- tables of keywords
